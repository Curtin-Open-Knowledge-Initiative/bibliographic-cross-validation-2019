# bibliographic-cross-validation-2019
This is a repository for r codes and data associated with the paper on cross-validation of bibliographic data sources.

The folder "documents" contains the main article and its supplementary material.

The folder "code and data" contains the r codes and relevant data to process the results and figures for the main article and its supplementary material. All sets of codes are setup in a way such that the codes will be able to run as long as all files are placed in a common folder.
